\section{Top Quark and Higgs Decay}
\label{problem_and_app}

In the LHC, two proton beams are accelerated close to the speed of light in opposite directions, set to collide inside a specific particle detector. From this head-on collision results a chain reaction of decaying particles, and most of the final particles react with the detector allowing their characteristics to be recorded. One of the experiments being conducted at the ATLAS detector is related to the studies of Top quark and Higgs boson properties. Figure \ref{fig:ttbar} presents the schematic representation of the top quark decay (addressed as the \ttbar system).

The ATLAS detector can record the characteristics of the bottom quarks, detected as a jet of particles, and leptons (muon and electron). However, neutrinos do not interact with the detector and, therefore, their characteristics are not recorded. Since the Top quark reconstruction requires the neutrinos, their characteristics are analytically determined with the known information of the system, in a process known as kinematical reconstruction. The reconstruction of the whole \ttbar system has a degree of certainty associated, which determines its quality.

The amount of Bottom quark jets and leptons detected may vary between events, due to other reactions occurring alongside the Top quark decay. As represented in figure \ref{fig:ttbar}, 2 jets and 2 leptons are needed to reconstruct the \ttbar system, but the input data for an event may have many more of these particles associated. It is necessary to reconstruct the system for every combination of 2 jets and 2 leptons in the input data (referred only as combination). Then, only the most accurate reconstruction of each event is considered.

The Higgs boson is reconstructed after the \ttbar system, with the two jets that it decays to. This adds at least two more jets to the event information, increasing the number of possible combinations, as they are the same as the \ttbar system jets. The Higgs boson reconstruction uses the jets that were not needed in the \ttbar system. The overall quality of the event reconstruction depends on the quality of both \ttbar system and Higgs boson reconstructions.

The ATLAS detector experimental resolution induces an error of 2\% in each measure of the particle characteristics. The reconstruction of both \ttbar system and Higgs boson will have an error associated due to this. To improve the quality of the reconstructions it is possible to apply a random variation to the particles parameters, with a maximum magnitude of 2\%, a given amount of times and chose the reconstructions that better fits the theoretical model. The quality of the reconstructions, and application execution time, are directly proportional to the amount of variations per combination performed. The goal is to perform as many variations as possibly within a reasonable time frame.

The \tth application was designed the reconstructions of the \ttbar system and Higgs boson, as explained above. The application flow is presented in figure \ref{fig:ttbar}. The data of an event is loaded to a single global state shared among the application and the LipMiniAnalysis library, and it is overwritten every time a new event is loaded. Then the event is submitted to a series of cuts, which filter the events that are not suited for reconstruction. When an event reaches the cut 20 the \ttbar system and Higgs boson are reconstructed in a function named \ttDilepKinFit. If an event has a possible reconstruction it passes the final cut and its information is stored.
